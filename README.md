I approach projects by focusing on understanding the requirements, breaking down the components, and using modular design principles. My work on a 3D scene project has helped me develop new design skills, such as efficiently using basic geometric shapes to construct complex objects and applying realistic textures and lighting. I followed a structured design process involving initial planning, iterative development, and constant testing to ensure each component worked seamlessly. This approach, emphasizing iteration and modularity, can be applied to future projects to improve efficiency and outcomes. I used new development strategies in programming, such as incorporating user-friendly navigation controls and optimizing scene performance through efficient polygon management. Iteration played a crucial role in refining the scene's realism and functionality, with continuous feedback and adjustments. As I reached project milestones, my coding approach became more systematic and organized, leading to a polished final product. My knowledge of computer science has equipped me with the tools and methodologies for creating complex, interactive applications. Skills in computational graphics and visualizations have provided me with expertise in 3D modeling, texture mapping, and real-time rendering, which are valuable in both my educational and professional pursuits. These skills enhance my ability to develop immersive environments and interactive experiences, applicable in fields like game development, virtual simulations, and educational tools.
